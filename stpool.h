 *
 *      .STTASK_VMARK_REMOVE
 *            If the task is in the pending queue, the task will be removed and the task's
 *         vmflags will be set, But if the task is being scheduled or is being dispatched,

 *	    .STMASK_VMARK_REMOVE_BYPOOL
 *			  The diference between STTASK_VMARK_REMOVE is that the completion routines of the 
 *		  tasks marked with STTASK_VMARK_REMOVE will be called by @stpool_mark_task itself, but
 *		  if the tasks are marked with STMASK_VMARK_REMOVE_BYPOOL, the tasks will be removed

 *
 *   NOTE:
 *   	 Only tasks who is in the pending queue can be marked with STTASK_VMARK_REMOVE or
